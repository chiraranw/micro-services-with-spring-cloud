# Micro-services with Spring Cloud

This application is a Spring Boot application that demonstarate how to develop Micro-services with Spring Cloud Technologies.
I have used the following tools in this project:
  
    1.Spring Boot - wiring the services
    2.Eureka - for service discovery
    3.Hystrix - for load balancing
    
The project consists of 4 applications/services, each a Spring Boot application.When the services are running, they allow a ```Student``` to borrow ```Book```s, this operation is controlled and made possible by all the four services.
